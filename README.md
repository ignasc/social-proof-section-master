## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 and CSS (grid mainly)
- Visual Studio Code software

### What I learned

Grid templates are very easy to use when it comes to offsetting elements and still aligning them ar the edges of the page

### Continued development

One of the bigger challenges not only on this one, but also on all previous projects is to keep things organised and avoid ending up with a ton of classes and id's.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com) - My main goto when I need to remember certain things in html and css.
